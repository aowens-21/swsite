      <description>Level Editor Code available here.
This is the second week of 2018 and it&amp;rsquo;s the second week I decided to do some programming and blogging. This week I wanted to write something in Python because I like the language a lot and I&amp;rsquo;m going to be using it for a class this semester. I decided to make a very small grid-based level editor using the 2D game framework pygame. This level editor is super simple, and it needs a lot of work before I&amp;rsquo;d use it for an actual game, but it was a good learning experience in both python and pygame.</description>

      <description>Starting a Blog It&amp;rsquo;s New Year&amp;rsquo;s Resolution time, which is as good a time as any to start my programming blog. I&amp;rsquo;ll start off by introducing myself. My name is Alex Owens, and I&amp;rsquo;m a Computer Science student at Northern Kentucky University. I&amp;rsquo;m in my third year of school, and I&amp;rsquo;m starting this blog as a really informal way to document my development as a programmer. The format for this site will be pretty simple: weekly blog posts about whatever I&amp;rsquo;m working on that week.</description>

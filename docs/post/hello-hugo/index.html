<h2 id="starting-a-blog">Starting a Blog</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s New Year&rsquo;s Resolution time, which is as good a time as any to start my programming blog. I&rsquo;ll start off by introducing myself. My name is Alex Owens, and I&rsquo;m
a Computer Science student at Northern Kentucky University. I&rsquo;m in my third year of school, and I&rsquo;m starting this blog as a really informal way to document my development
as a programmer. The format for this site will be pretty simple: weekly blog posts about whatever I&rsquo;m working on that week. There won&rsquo;t be any clearly defined structure for each
post or length requirement, I&rsquo;m just going to share my work with whoever ends up reading this. Each post will have a corresponding GitHub repo, since I&rsquo;m going to try and work on something
different every single week. Most of the time, I&rsquo;d imagine that the projects will be pretty small, as I work a job and go to school full-time, but I&rsquo;m going to try to be as
consistent and as varied as possible. It&rsquo;s also possible that I&rsquo;ll have multiple things to talk about some weeks, and I may do some blogs related to game design instead of programming.</p>

<p>I used the wonderful <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo Framework</a> to make this site, and I&rsquo;ve created my own (very barebones as you can see) theme to go along with it. At the time of writing this, there are some
changes to the design that I have planned, so at some point over the next few weeks this site should start looking better. If you&rsquo;re interested in checking out the source code for the site, it&rsquo;s on my
GitHub page at the <a href="https://github.com/aowens-21/swsite">swsite repository</a>. That being said, there are a few themes that I looked at while making my own as a sort of supplement to the official Hugo documentation, and they&rsquo;re very good references as well. They are the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/minimal/">Minimal Theme</a> by <a href="https://github.com/calintat">Calin Tataru</a> and the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-journal/">Journal Theme</a> by <a href="https://github.com/damiencaselli">Damien Caselli</a>.</p>

<p>I know this post is pretty short, but usually the posts will be a little longer and they will definitely look more at the technical aspects of whatever I&rsquo;ve been working on. Maybe at a later date after I&rsquo;ve cleaned up some of the code for the website I&rsquo;ll talk about how I did everything. I&rsquo;d like to take a while and make it look better as well as take advantage of a few of Hugo&rsquo;s more complex features. Thanks a lot for reading this introductory post and I hope you&rsquo;re excited for my post next week!</p>

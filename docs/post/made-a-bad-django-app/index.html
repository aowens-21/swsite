<h2 id="a-due-date-app-in-django">A Due Date App in Django</h2>

<p>Code is available <a href="https://github.com/aowens-21/due-date">here</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry this blog post is late, which means there&rsquo;s another one coming tomorrow night. This week I focused on learning a bit more about
<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> by making an app that was sort of like the tutorial app I made last week. I decided to do something
that at least has the potential to be useful: a date-sorted to-do list.</p>

<h2 id="the-app">The App</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a picture of the homepage of the app:</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p>While it&rsquo;s very primitive in terms of style, I think the building blocks are there. In Django especially it would be pretty easy to expand this
into a pretty interesting and useful application. What&rsquo;s also interesting is that it&rsquo;s insanely simple to sort the due dates using built-in Django functionality,
here&rsquo;s the entire function for the index page view:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">                  def index(request):
                      upcoming_assignments = Assignment.objects.filter(completed=False).order_by('due_date')
                      context = {'upcoming_assignments': upcoming_assignments}
                      return render(request, 'due/index.html', context)
</code></pre>

<p>All it&rsquo;s doing is storing all the assignment objects that aren&rsquo;t completed into a list and then sorting them the due date field. The view then stores
this into a dictionary called <code>context</code>, and that is passed to the page template which uses it to render the actual date. This brings us to
the template:</p>

<pre><code class="language-HTML">                  &lt;h1&gt;Upcoming Assignments&lt;/h1&gt;
                  &lt;br /&gt;
                  {% if upcoming_assignments %}
                    &lt;ul&gt;
                    {% for assignment in upcoming_assignments %}
                        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{% url 'due:detail' assignment.id %}&quot;&gt;{{ assignment.name }} - Due: {{ assignment.due_date }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                    {% endfor %}
                  {% else %}
                    &lt;p&gt;No assignments due, take a break!&lt;/p&gt;
                  {% endif %}
                  &lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot; href=&quot;{% url 'due:create_assignment' %}&quot;&gt;Create Assignment&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the template is pretty simple too. It&rsquo;s just Django&rsquo;s official template language interspersed with some HTML. You can see we&rsquo;re checking for the
<code>upcoming_assignments</code> list that pass in from the view, and if there aren&rsquo;t any we display a static message. This language is pretty flexible and I believe the context
dictionary can be as big as you need it to.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of other, similar code for the few other pages in the application that you can check out over on my GitHub. There&rsquo;s also a lot
of Django features I didn&rsquo;t use here, and I mean a lot. For example, instead of using functions to create views to handle responses, you can have
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/class-based-views/">class-based views</a> which I think allows for more scalability. That is one of the things I really enjoy
about using Django. It seems like overkill for a really small project like this (and it probably is), but if you&rsquo;re building something big then the features
are pretty much there whenever you need them. I think I&rsquo;m going to stick with Django for a couple more weeks, so the next few blog posts might also be Django related, but
after that I&rsquo;m going to check out a smaller framework like <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> or <a href="https://trypyramid.com/">Pyramid</a>. I think I need to dip my toes into the
basics before I dive back into something as huge as Django.</p>

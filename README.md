# Swsite

*** This is a now deprecated site, and it is no longer hosted anywhere. ***

This is a repo for my old personal site. It's made using the Hugo framework, although at the moment it doesn't take advantage of many of Hugo's features. This was mostly an exercise in learning the Hugo framework and designing a small site from scratch.

Starting a Blog
---------------
It's New Year's Resolution time, which is as good a time as any to start my programming blog. I'll start off by introducing myself. My name is Alex Owens, and I'm
a Computer Science student at Northern Kentucky University. I'm in my third year of school, and I'm starting this blog as a really informal way to document my development
as a programmer. The format for this site will be pretty simple: weekly blog posts about whatever I'm working on that week. There won't be any clearly defined structure for each
post or length requirement, I'm just going to share my work with whoever ends up reading this. Each post will have a corresponding GitHub repo, since I'm going to try and work on something
different every single week. Most of the time, I'd imagine that the projects will be pretty small, as I work a job and go to school full-time, but I'm going to try to be as
consistent and as varied as possible. It's also possible that I'll have multiple things to talk about some weeks, and I may do some blogs related to game design instead of programming.

I used the wonderful [Hugo Framework](www.gohugo.io) to make this site, and I've created my own (very barebones as you can see) theme to go along with it. At the time of writing this, there are some
changes to the design that I have planned, so at some point over the next few weeks this site should start looking better. If you're interested in checking out the source code for the site, it's on my
GitHub page at the [swsite repository](https://github.com/aowens-21/swsite). That being said, there are a few themes that I looked at while making my own as a sort of supplement to the official Hugo documentation, and they're very good references as well. They are the [Minimal Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/minimal/) by [Calin Tataru](https://github.com/calintat) and the [Journal Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-journal/) by [Damien Caselli](https://github.com/damiencaselli).

I know this post is pretty short, but usually the posts will be a little longer and they will definitely look more at the technical aspects of whatever I've been working on. Maybe at a later date after I've cleaned up some of the code for the website I'll talk about how I did everything. I'd like to take a while and make it look better as well as take advantage of a few of Hugo's more complex features. Thanks a lot for reading this introductory post and I hope you're excited for my post next week!
